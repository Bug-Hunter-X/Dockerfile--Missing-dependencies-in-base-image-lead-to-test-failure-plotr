# Dockerfile Bug: Missing Dependencies

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failing to install necessary dependencies in the base image.  The provided `Dockerfile` attempts to run unit tests using `unittest`, but the necessary Python packages are missing. This leads to the tests failing during the build process.  The solution provided demonstrates how to correctly install required packages within the Dockerfile.

## Bug

The original `Dockerfile` uses a minimal base image (`ubuntu:latest`) without explicitly installing `python3` and `python3-pip`.  Consequently, the `CMD` instruction, which tries to execute the tests, will fail because the required Python interpreter and the `unittest` module are not present.

## Solution

The `DockerfileSolution.txt` includes the necessary steps to install Python and its testing framework (`unittest`) before running the test suite. This ensures that the execution environment is properly configured and the tests will execute correctly.
